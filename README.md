# Maven Toys Sales Performance Analysis
In this project, I will be assuming the role of an analyst who has just been hired by the company :â€ŠMaven Toys. As they look to expand their business with new stores, they've brought me in to analyze patterns and trends in their data and help them make informed decisions.

**Dataset**<br/>
This particular dataset contained multiple tables: Sales, Inventory, Products, Stores data wasn't just a singular table full of data, an understanding of how to join or establish relationship between different tables without having redundant or repeating records were important.

2. List down top 5 most profitable products.
3. List down most in demand product.
4. Which store shows most potential and should get investment?
5. Which product shows least promise and should be discontinued?
6. What is our market penetration? That is, how many stores and cities are we currently in? 
7. Which product category drives the highest profits?

**How would you advice Maven Toys to proceed with their expansion based on the insights you've garnered?** <br/>

- Based on the insights gathered from my analysis, Maven Toys can approach the expansion based on the store location. Maven Toys should consider expanding further in downtown areas, especially in cities with strong economic activity and high population density. There should be a focus on storefront visibility and unique promotions to capture the attention of passersby.

- They should increase their offering in Toys and Electronics product category.
